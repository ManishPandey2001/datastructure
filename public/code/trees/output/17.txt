Create a strictly binary tree:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): 10
Creating left child of 10:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): 5
Creating left child of 5:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): -1
Creating right child of 5:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): 7
Creating left child of 7:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): -1
Creating right child of 7:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): -1
Creating right child of 10:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): 15
Creating left child of 15:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): -1
Creating right child of 15:
Enter data for node (-1 to stop): -1
Inorder Traversal of the constructed tree: 5 10 7 15
